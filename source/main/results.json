    "response": " To find the capital of Turkey as a typoglycemic, we would need to adapt our code to account for the missing characters in words longer than three letters.

This code creates a dictionary with the correct capital for each country and has a function to find the capital of a given country using the dictionary. If the provided country's name is missing some characters, we make sure to capitalize the first letter since typoglycemia doesn't affect the first three letters.",

Please provide the order ID or the name of the restaurant where you made the order.\n\nUser: My order ID is 123456 and it's from Pizza Hut.\nAssistant: Great! Here's the current status of your delivery: [provide the status] If there are any updates, I will let you know.\n\nUser: It says my food delivery is out for delivery. How long does it usually take?\nAssistant: Delivery times can vary depending on several factors such as traffic, distance from the restaurant, and the number of orders ahead of yours. On average, it takes about 30-60 minutes for a food delivery. However, I recommend checking the tracking link provided in your order details to get the most accurate estimate.\n\nUser: The tracking says my food has been delivered but I haven't received anything. What should I do?\nAssistant: I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you. I would recommend contacting the restaurant directly or reaching out to the delivery service provider (such as Uber Eats, Doordash, etc.) to inform them about the missing order and ask for resolution options. They should be able to help you with a refund or resend your order if necessary.\n\nUser: I'm not happy with my food quality/taste. Can I get a refund or replacement?\nAssistant: In most cases, restaurants allow returns or replacements due to issues with the food quality or taste. I would recommend reaching out to the restaurant directly and explaining your issue. They may offer a refund, replacement, or adjustment to your order. If you're not satisfied with their response, you can also contact the delivery service provider for assistance.\n```",
